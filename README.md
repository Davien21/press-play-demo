A demo for a podcast streaming project


### How to contribute: 
1. Fork this repo ðŸ˜‰   
2. Set your upstream to this repo with this command:   
``git remote add upstream https://github.com/Davien21/press-play-demo.git``   
3. Run ``git remote -v`` and confirm you have 2 remotes **origin** and **upstream**   
3. Never push to the master branch, only push to the deploy branch.    
4. If you are confused about anything regarding **git** google it or ask the owner of this repo. 


### How to collaborate: ðŸ˜ƒ
1. Split up coding tasks amongst team mates and begin working on your task.    
2. You can break down your tasks into features and follow the rules about **How to contribute**   
3. For **React** code, you can split work in terms of either **pages** or **components**   
4. Try to split the work in a way that you will hardly require another person's code (maybe a component for example) as a dependency.    
5. Make sure you and your teammates are **NEVER** working on the **same file** at a time, ever.    
If you have a problem / suggestion or issue with their work, inform them via github issues or a message      
We don't need any conflicts pleaseðŸ¥º 

### Extra Info:
1. Always ask questions, don't hesitate and don't waste too much time thinking, trust me (work smart, not hard) ðŸ˜‰  
2. Do not be a coconut head oh, please!!!ðŸ˜© 
3. VERY IMPORTANT! -    
Always pull from the **upstream** (my repo, not the one you forked) **deploy** branch before making any changes.    
By running this command:    
``git pull upstream deploy``   
Changes include: adding new files, deleting, pushing
It's stressful, but please **always** do it   
4. Also, you pull from the upstream(my repo), but you push to the origin(your repo).    
Sample commands are:    
``git pull upstream deploy`` - pulling from upstream.   
``git push -u origin deploy`` - pushing to the origin



### Samples for how to split work:
Remember rule #4 from **How to collaborate**?
Here's a couple of example ways to follow it:
1. Split work in terms of **Structure (HTML)**, **Styles (CSS)** and **functionality (JS)**   
I would recommend that for a 2-man team:   
**Person A** - Structure and Functionality     
**Person B** - Styles     

2. In a **React** Environment, it is difficult to follow method #1.
Here's a few different approaches:    
  **I**.   
  **Person A** - Build the UI and anything that is not a component    
  **Person B** - Build all components    
  **II**.   
  **Person A** - Build a static UI for the entire web app    
  **Person B** - Implement / extend functionality across the website

### Building a new feature: ðŸ˜Ž
A new feature can be page / component (basically any new working piece of code)    
When you want to build one, here's some rules and things to consider.     
1. Create a new branch for this feature and work on it locally    
2. Test this new feature to make sure it is working and not breaking any part of the application     
3. Make a commit with a clear and concise message about what you just did.    
4. Merge to the **deploy** branch
5. run ``git push -u origin deploy``
6. Make a pull request on github.    
7. I will review your code and if I do not approve the pull request, I will comment on your code.    
8. If you enter merge conflicts, or anything you're not sure you can / should handle please do not hesitate to ask me for help.
